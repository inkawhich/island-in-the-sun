## Basics:

1. Make sure your training and testing dictionaries are built

2. Run the train and save script which will train a model on the training dictionary and save the trained models as a predict and init net

3. Run the test **dictionary** script to test the trained model from 2. and get an % accuracy

4. If the model tests well in 3. run the test **directory** script to run the model on the true test dataset and format a csv file for submission. This csv file can be copied and pasted into Kaggle for a submission
